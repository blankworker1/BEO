# BEO - Bitcoin Energy Observatory 

Introduction to the Bitcoin Energy Observatory (BEO)

Bitcoin Energy Observatory (BEO) is a non-profit research initiative measuring and analyzing the energy consumption of Bitcoin mining to produce open, reproducible data for science, policy, and sustainable land-use innovation.

## About BEO

The Bitcoin Energy Observatory (BEO) mission is to collect, analyze, and publish high-quality, reproducible data linking energy consumption to Bitcoin production under controlled and real-world conditions. Through its research, BEO aims to provide evidence-based insights for policymakers, academics, farmers, and energy stakeholders.


---

## Objectives

BEO’s primary objective is to establish a coordinated research programme that investigates the interaction of digital asset production, renewable energy systems, and land use. The goals are to:

1. Design and operate standardized Bitcoin energy monitoring stations, capable of capturing detailed, time-resolved measurements of energy input and Bitcoin output.


2. Explore renewable energy deployment in agricultural settings, including multifunctional land use, agrivoltaics, and mobile energy systems.


3. Create open, high-quality datasets and validated methodologies to support policy development, scientific research, and educational initiatives.


4. Establish a network of research partners across the Mediterranean to enable cross-regional data collection and replication.

## Purpose of This Introduction

The purpose of this document is to introduce BEO to potential stakeholders and collaborators, including:

Universities and research institutes

Regional and local government bodies

Agricultural associations and cooperatives

Industry partners in renewable energy and monitoring technologies


BEO is seeking support and partnerships to apply for funding to run the joint research programme, which consists of:

### [Project A: Laboratory-Scale Research Project to validate the measurement instrument and establish baseline data]()

### [Project B: Agricultural Research Project deploying mobile monitoring systems in real-world farming contexts to evaluate energy, Bitcoin, and land-use outcomes]()


Through these projects, BEO will build the foundation for a distributed observatory network, capable of producing scientifically credible and policy-relevant insights about Bitcoin energy use and multifunctional renewable energy deployment.
