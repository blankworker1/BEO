# Bitcoin Energy Observatory (BEO): Agriculture Research Project Proposal

---

## 1. Executive Summary

This proposal is submitted alongside the **BEO Laboratory-Scale Research Project**, which establishes the core Bitcoin Energy Observatory methodology as an **off-grid monitoring and data collection instrument**. The laboratory-scale project focuses on controlled measurement of energy-to-Bitcoin conversion under fixed physical conditions.

The present **BEO Agriculture Research Project** builds on that foundation by deploying the same validated measurement system in a real-world agricultural context. Together, the two projects form a coherent research program: the laboratory-scale installation defines the baseline measurement framework, while the agricultural deployment tests its applicability, robustness, and relevance under operational land-use conditions.

The projects are designed to be **scientifically complementary and jointly fundable**, sharing instrumentation standards, data schemas, and analytical methods.

Agricultural land is often left fallow as part of crop rotation to restore soil fertility, presenting an opportunity for seasonal energy generation. This research investigates the deployment of **containerized, roll-out photovoltaic (PV) systems** on fallow or uncultivated land, combined with **organic weed suppression fabrics**, to provide **renewable electricity for on-farm Bitcoin mining**.

Unlike traditional crops, PV energy yield is **non-extractive**, requiring no fertilizers or irrigation, and can potentially improve soil fertility through shading and mulch effects. The study will evaluate **energy generation, Bitcoin mining output, soil health, and operational logistics**, while comparing **per-hectare economic returns** with high-value Mediterranean crops such as tomatoes.

By integrating PV deployment into crop rotation and seasonal land management, the project aims to demonstrate a **multifunctional land-use model** that enhances farm profitability, maintains soil health, and leverages renewable energy without compromising agricultural productivity. The findings are expected to provide farmers with a **scalable, flexible, and sustainable strategy** for combining renewable energy, digital asset production, and traditional crop cultivation.

## 2. Background and Motivation

### Prior BEO Proof of Concept

The Bitcoin Energy Observatory has already **designed, built, and tested a working proof-of-concept energy-to-Bitcoin system**. This initial BEO installation consists of a small, off-grid renewable energy setup directly coupled to ASIC Bitcoin mining hardware, with revenue-grade energy metering, environmental sensors, and time-synchronized data logging.

The proof of concept successfully demonstrated:

* Reliable conversion of locally generated renewable energy into Bitcoin
* Continuous measurement of kWh input and BTC output
* Stable operation of mining hardware under variable energy supply
* End-to-end data collection linking physical energy flows with Bitcoin network and market data

This foundational work validates the **technical feasibility** of BEO’s measurement approach and reduces execution risk for subsequent research phases.

The proposed BEO Agriculture project builds directly on this proven system, extending controlled measurement from a laboratory-style installation into a **real-world agricultural context**. By deploying the already-tested energy-to-Bitcoin hardware within working farmland, the project enables BEO instrumentation to capture how renewable energy conversion behaves under realistic land-use, operational, and seasonal conditions.

### Why Sardinia

Sardinia provides an exceptional pilot location for the BEO Agriculture research project due to a unique convergence of **agricultural practices, climate conditions, and energy context**:

* **High solar irradiance**: Sardinia has among the highest annual solar yields in Europe, enabling reliable measurement of kWh/ha/day from portable PV systems and reducing weather-related noise in early-stage experiments.

* **Prevalence of fallow and rotational land**: Mediterranean farming systems commonly include fallow periods to restore soil fertility. This creates an ideal real-world setting to test seasonal, non-permanent PV deployment without displacing food production.

* **Water stress and climate resilience relevance**: As a semi-arid region increasingly affected by drought, Sardinia highlights the value of **non-irrigated, non-extractive land uses** that can generate economic output without additional water demand.

* **Representative Mediterranean agriculture**: Crops such as tomatoes, cereals, and olives provide meaningful benchmarks for per-hectare economic comparisons relevant across Southern Europe.

* **Island energy dynamics**: Sardinia’s partial energy isolation and historically higher electricity costs make it a compelling case study for decentralized, on-farm energy production and consumption.

* **Scalability and transferability**: Findings from Sardinia are directly transferable to other Mediterranean and Southern European regions facing similar climate, soil, and energy-transition challenges.

Together, these factors make Sardinia a scientifically robust and policy-relevant testbed for evaluating multifunctional land use at the intersection of agriculture, renewable energy, and digital infrastructure.

Agricultural land is increasingly being repurposed for solar PV installations, raising concerns about food security and land-use conflicts. Agrivoltaics offers a potential solution, allowing **simultaneous production of food and renewable energy**. However, the actual energy and economic yields of such systems—especially when electricity is used for Bitcoin mining—remain largely unquantified.

The BEO provides a unique platform for this study by offering **direct, high-resolution measurement of energy-to-Bitcoin conversion**, while also allowing precise crop monitoring beneath the PV panels. The **mobile container-based approach** further enables flexible deployment for testing different crops, climates, and solar conditions.

## 3. Research Aims

### Primary Aim

To empirically quantify the **energy, economic, and land-use efficiency of mobile agrivoltaic systems** where solar energy is directly used for Bitcoin mining, and crops are cultivated underneath.

### Secondary Aims

1. Measure kWh/ha/day generated by mobile agrivoltaic PV arrays.
2. Determine BTC/ha/day from locally produced energy.
3. Quantify crop yield impacts due to shading and altered microclimate.
4. Compare combined agrivoltaic energy and economic yield with traditional single-use PV and conventional cropping.
5. Develop guidelines for **optimal panel height, spacing, crop selection, and container deployment strategies**.

## 4. Core Research Questions

1. How much solar energy can be harvested per hectare in a mobile agrivoltaic setup while allowing crop growth underneath?
2. What is the effective BTC output per hectare using energy from these panels?
3. How do crop yields respond to partial shading from PV panels, and what are the microclimatic effects?
4. What are the trade-offs and synergies in terms of **total energy, crop production, and economic yield** compared to single-use PV or conventional agriculture?
5. How does portability and relocation affect the performance and data consistency of the system?

## 5. Hypotheses

1. **Energy Hypothesis**: Mobile agrivoltaic systems produce slightly less solar energy per hectare than permanent PV installations but remain economically viable when used for Bitcoin mining.
2. **Crop Hypothesis**: Certain crops experience minimal yield reduction under PV shading, while others may benefit from microclimate effects (e.g., reduced heat stress).
3. **Combined Yield Hypothesis**: Total economic return (BTC + crops) from mobile agrivoltaics exceeds that of single-use PV or conventional crops alone.
4. **Portability Hypothesis**: Relocation of the mobile BEO station allows comparative trials without significant disruption to data collection or system performance.
