# Joint Programme Overview

---

## Programme Purpose

The Bitcoin Energy Observatory (BEO) is a coordinated research programme designed to address a core deficiency in current discussions about Bitcoin and energy: **the absence of direct, empirical, reproducible measurements linking physical energy inputs to Bitcoin outputs under controlled and real-world conditions**.

Public debate, academic research, and policy analysis around Bitcoin’s energy use are currently dominated by **modeled estimates, global averages, and inferred assumptions** about miner behavior and electricity prices. These approaches obscure local variability, limit falsifiability, and provide weak foundations for scientific or policy conclusions.

The BEO programme seeks to replace inference with **instrumented observation**.

---

## Core Problems the Programme Addresses

### 1. Lack of Ground-Truth Measurement

There is no widely accepted empirical dataset measuring:

* energy input (kWh),
* Bitcoin output (BTC),
* and network/market context

within a clearly defined physical control volume.

BEO addresses this by treating Bitcoin mining as a **measurable physical process**, analogous to energy conversion systems studied in other scientific domains.

---

### 2. Over-Reliance on Global Models and Averages

Most existing Bitcoin energy studies rely on:

* assumed electricity prices,
* inferred miner locations,
* modeled hardware efficiency,
* and estimated network behavior.

These approaches smooth away regional, temporal, and operational differences that are essential for understanding how Bitcoin actually behaves in practice.

BEO replaces global averages with **local, time-resolved measurements**, enabling comparison across sites, seasons, and operating conditions.

---

### 3. Unclear Relationship Between Energy, Price, and Protocol Dynamics

A central unresolved question is the direction of causality between:

* energy expenditure,
* Bitcoin market price,
* and Bitcoin protocol mechanisms such as difficulty adjustment and halving.

BEO is explicitly designed to study **lead–lag relationships** between these variables using synchronized physical and market data, without assuming causality in advance.

---

### 4. Absence of a Standardized Research Instrument

Bitcoin-energy research lacks a standardized, replicable experimental apparatus.

The BEO programme introduces a **"Bitcoin energy monitoring station"**—a modular, off-grid, instrumented system that can be deployed, replicated, and calibrated across multiple contexts, similar in spirit to weather or environmental monitoring stations.

---

### 5. Poor Integration of Land-Use, Energy, and Digital Infrastructure Research

Discussions around renewable energy deployment, land use, and digital infrastructure are often siloed.

BEO integrates these domains by:

* measuring renewable energy generation,
* observing digital asset production,
* and, in applied projects, evaluating land-use and agricultural impacts.

This enables evidence-based assessment of multifunctional land-use models.

---

## Programme Structure

The BEO programme is structured as **two complementary research projects**:

### Project A: Laboratory-Scale BEO

* Establishes the core measurement instrument
* Operates off-grid under controlled conditions
* Produces baseline BTC/kWh datasets
* Defines data standards and protocols

### Project B: BEO Agriculture

* Deploys the validated instrument in real-world agricultural settings
* Tests seasonal, mobile, and land-use-integrated energy systems
* Measures per-hectare energy, Bitcoin, and economic yield
* Evaluates soil, operational, and agronomic context

Together, the projects form a **coherent research pipeline** from controlled measurement to applied evaluation.

---

## Long-Term Vision

The long-term objective of the BEO programme is the creation of a **distributed network of Bitcoin energy monitoring stations**, enabling:

* cross-regional comparison,
* long-term time series analysis,
* and open, reproducible research.

By grounding debate in measured reality, the BEO programme aims to provide policymakers, researchers, and practitioners with a **robust empirical foundation** for decisions at the intersection of energy, land use, and digital infrastructure.

## Joint Expected Impact

The BEO programme is expected to deliver impact across **scientific research, public policy, agricultural practice, and energy system understanding** by introducing direct measurement where inference currently dominates.

### 1. Scientific Impact

* Establishes the first **empirically grounded, reproducible measurement framework** for studying Bitcoin mining as a physical energy conversion process.
* Produces high-resolution, open datasets linking **kWh input, BTC output, protocol dynamics, and market signals**.
* Enables falsifiable testing of claims about Bitcoin’s relationship to energy, price, and efficiency.
* Creates a standardized experimental apparatus analogous to a **weather station**, suitable for replication and long-term observation.

### 2. Policy and Regulatory Impact

* Provides policymakers with **measured evidence** rather than modeled estimates when assessing Bitcoin’s energy and environmental implications.
* Informs EU decision-making on renewable energy integration, decentralized energy systems, and digital infrastructure.
* Supports evidence-based evaluation of multifunctional land use, particularly where energy generation intersects with agriculture.

### 3. Agricultural and Land-Use Impact

* Demonstrates how renewable energy systems can be **integrated into crop rotation, fallow land management, and seasonal land use** without displacing food production.
* Provides farmers with quantitative comparisons of **per-hectare energy, Bitcoin, and crop yields**.
* Explores non-extractive revenue streams that reduce dependence on water, fertilizers, and inputs under climate stress.

### 4. Energy Systems and Innovation Impact

* Advances understanding of **off-grid, flexible, and mobile renewable energy systems**.
* Demonstrates novel demand-side use of renewable energy that can operate intermittently and adapt to variable supply.
* Contributes to research on decentralized energy consumption aligned with local generation.

### 5. Open Science and Long-Term Impact

* Commits to **open data, transparent methods, and reproducible research**.
* Lays the foundation for a **distributed Bitcoin Energy Observatory network**, enabling cross-regional and longitudinal studies.
* Improves the quality of public discourse by grounding debate in measurable reality rather than assumptions.
