Bitcoin Energy Observatory (BEO)

Joint Programme Overview


---

## Programme Purpose

The Bitcoin Energy Observatory (BEO) is a coordinated research programme designed to address a core deficiency in current discussions about Bitcoin and energy: the absence of direct, empirical, reproducible measurements linking physical energy inputs to Bitcoin outputs under controlled and real-world conditions.

Public debate, academic research, and policy analysis around Bitcoin’s energy use are currently dominated by modeled estimates, global averages, and inferred assumptions about miner behavior and electricity prices. These approaches obscure local variability, limit falsifiability, and provide weak foundations for scientific or policy conclusions.

The BEO programme seeks to replace inference with instrumented observation.

## Core Problems the Programme Addresses

1. Lack of Ground-Truth Measurement

There is no widely accepted empirical dataset measuring:

energy input (kWh),

Bitcoin output (BTC),

and network/market context


within a clearly defined physical control volume.

BEO addresses this by treating Bitcoin mining as a measurable physical process, analogous to energy conversion systems studied in other scientific domains.


---

2. Over-Reliance on Global Models and Averages

Most existing Bitcoin energy studies rely on:

assumed electricity prices,

inferred miner locations,

modeled hardware efficiency,

and estimated network behavior.


These approaches smooth away regional, temporal, and operational differences that are essential for understanding how Bitcoin actually behaves in practice.

BEO replaces global averages with local, time-resolved measurements, enabling comparison across sites, seasons, and operating conditions.


---

3. Unclear Relationship Between Energy, Price, and Protocol Dynamics

A central unresolved question is the direction of causality between:

energy expenditure,

Bitcoin market price,

and Bitcoin protocol mechanisms such as difficulty adjustment and halving.


BEO is explicitly designed to study lead–lag relationships between these variables using synchronized physical and market data, without assuming causality in advance.


---

4. Absence of a Standardized Research Instrument

Bitcoin-energy research lacks a standardized, replicable experimental apparatus.

The BEO programme introduces a "Bitcoin energy monitoring station"—a modular, off-grid, instrumented system that can be deployed, replicated, and calibrated across multiple contexts, similar in spirit to weather or environmental monitoring stations.


---

5. Poor Integration of Land-Use, Energy, and Digital Infrastructure Research

Discussions around renewable energy deployment, land use, and digital infrastructure are often siloed.

BEO integrates these domains by:

measuring renewable energy generation,

observing digital asset production,

and, in applied projects, evaluating land-use and agricultural impacts.


This enables evidence-based assessment of multifunctional land-use models.

## BEO Mediterranean Roll-Out Strategy

The BEO programme is designed for gradual, scalable deployment of standardized Bitcoin energy monitoring installations across the Mediterranean region. The strategy proceeds in two overlapping phases:

### Phase 1 – Sardinia Pilot & Observational Partnership

Project A (Laboratory-Scale) and Project B (Agriculture) are implemented in Sardinia.

Partners from Spain, Greece, or other Mediterranean regions participate as observers.

Observing partners gain:

Real-time access to all collected data

Exposure to BEO operational protocols

Insight into data analysis pipelines, instrument calibration, and agricultural integration


Ensures knowledge transfer and local capacity building without immediate on-site deployment.


### Phase 2 – Regional Expansion & Replication

Following Phase 1, observing partners are equipped to establish their own BEO installations locally.

BEO provides:

Technical support for hardware and software deployment

Training for personnel and researchers

Protocol templates for measurement, data logging, and open-data publication


Balances risk, cost, and quality control, validating methods in Sardinia first while preparing a distributed observatory network.


### Strategic Advantages

Scientific: Enables robust comparative studies across Mediterranean climates and land-use types.

Policy & Funding: Demonstrates scalability and EU-wide relevance, improving funder confidence.

Operational: Reduces start-up risk for new sites through observation-based learning.

Network Development: Establishes a foundation for a distributed Mediterranean BEO Observatory, facilitating long-term monitoring and open-data sharing.

## Programme Structure

The BEO programme is structured as two complementary research projects:

### Project A: Laboratory-Scale BEO

Establishes the core measurement instrument

Operates off-grid under controlled conditions

Produces baseline BTC/kWh datasets

Defines data standards and protocols


### Project B: BEO Agriculture

Deploys the validated instrument in real-world agricultural settings

Tests seasonal, mobile, and land-use-integrated energy systems

Measures per-hectare energy, Bitcoin, and economic yield

Evaluates soil, operational, and agronomic context


Together, the projects form a coherent research pipeline from controlled measurement to applied evaluation.


---

## Long-Term Vision

The long-term objective of the BEO programme is the creation of a distributed network of Bitcoin energy monitoring stations, enabling:

cross-regional comparison,

long-term time series analysis,

and open, reproducible research.


By grounding debate in measured reality, the BEO programme aims to provide policymakers, researchers, and practitioners with a robust empirical foundation for decisions at the intersection of energy, land use, and digital infrastructure.
