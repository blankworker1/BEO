# BEO Organization

Structure as a non profit association 

---

## 1. What BEO Should Look Like (Structure & Roles)

BEO as a scientific infrastructure + coordinating body:

A. Legal Form

Non-profit association / NGO (Italy: Associazione senza scopo di lucro)

Legally able to:

Receive grants (EU, national, regional)

Enter contracts with partners

Own and manage equipment and IP

Hire staff if needed



B. Governance

Board of Directors / Steering Committee

Chairperson (could be you or a neutral academic)

Representatives of core stakeholders (universities, regional government, agriculture body)


Scientific Advisory Board

Provides credibility to methodology and publications

Guides research direction and ensures independence


Operational Team

Technical lead (hardware/software)

Field operations coordinator

Data manager



C. Mission & Activities

Design, deploy, and operate Bitcoin energy monitoring stations

Collect, curate, and publish open datasets

Provide training and support for new regional observatories

Conduct applied research (e.g., agrivoltaics, energy-land use)

Disseminate results to policymakers, academic community, and stakeholders

## 2. Who to Reach Out to as Members

Members should add credibility, expertise, and network reach, not just symbolic titles. Consider:

A. Scientific Partners

Universities and research institutes with expertise in:

Energy systems / renewable energy

Environmental monitoring / agronomy

Data science / systems engineering


These partners may also:

Participate in advisory boards

Be co-authors on publications

Strengthen EU funding eligibility



B. Regional Government Bodies

Sardinia regional government departments for:

Energy

Agriculture

Innovation / economic development


They can provide:

Land access

Funding co-support or matching

Policy dissemination



C. Agricultural Associations

Farmers’ cooperatives or agricultural bodies

Can:

Provide land for pilot deployments

Help evaluate agronomic impacts

Engage the broader farming community



D. Technology & Industry Partners (Non-voting or supporting members)

PV providers, container systems, and mining hardware suppliers

Software/data platform companies

Their role:

Provide technical support and hardware

Offer operational insights

Avoid dominating research direction to maintain scientific independence



E. Optional International Observers

Potential Spain/Greece partners for cross-border capacity building

Access to data and best practices

May become formal members when they deploy local BEO installations

## 3. Key Principles for Membership

Scientific independence: Academic and advisory members must have influence over methodology and publication, but not day-to-day operations.

Diversity: Include technical, policy, and agricultural perspectives.

Networked, not centralized: Early BEO members should be a tight steering group; later observers can be added as network nodes.

Funding eligibility: Ensure members can collectively hold and manage EU/non-EU grants.

## NEXT STEPS 

1. Draft Articles of Association and clearly define:

Membership categories (founding, regular, associate)

Voting rights

Roles & responsibilities



2. Identify founding members:

1–2 universities / research institutes

Sardinia regional government

Agricultural body

You (as operational lead/farmer)



3. Establish Scientific Advisory Board:

3–5 academics with expertise in energy, agronomy, or data systems



4. Reach out to technical and industry partners as supporting members (PV, mining, monitoring software).
